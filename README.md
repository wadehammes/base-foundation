Base Foundation
======
Base Foundation is a template framework based on the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation</a> framework from Zurb, which utilizes <a href="http://sass-lang.com">SASS</a>, and is meant to be a starting point for a website build. It utilizes <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, which handles javascript tasks such as CSS minification and prefixing, SASS compilation, and JS concatenation and uglifying, folder syncing, and more.

####PRIOR TO USAGE:
You will need to make sure you have the following installed to your machine (via Terminal):

Install NPM first:
<a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">http://nodejs.org/download/</a>

Then Grunt:
<a href="http://gruntjs.com/getting-started">http://gruntjs.com/getting-started</a>

Then Bower:
<code>$ npm install -g bower</code>

After that, install some other dependencies:
<code>$ sudo gem install -g sass</code><br />
<code>$ sudo gem install bourbon -v 3.2.0</code>

You will also need to download Image Optim:
https://imageoptim.com/

Once you are ready to compile the project, download these files as a zip, decompress, and move them to your project directory. Then, in terminal:
<code>$ cd your/project/directory</code>

Install the Node Modules into the project:
<code>$ npm install</code>

Install the Bower dependencies into the project:
<code>$ bower install</code>

Install Bourbon to the project:
<code>$ bourbon install</code>

Initiate Grunt:
<code>$ grunt</code>

In order to update Bower, Bourbon, and Nodes:
<code>$ bourbon update</code>
<code>$ bower update</code>
<code>$ npm update</code>

Your project should compile, and you will receive notifications of things changing.

Start building something awesome.

####OTHER TIDBITS:
- Use scss/project/global for creating style guide classes and other re-usuable, global elements.
- Use scss/project/media/screen.scss for screen styles
- Use scss/project/media/print.scss for print styles

For development:
Do your JS work in <code>js/</code> and all your styling within <code>scss/</code>. Do not remove OR write css in the <code>css/</code> directory. This folder is being generated by the Grunt tasks. The <code>www/</code> directory is meant to be your static build folder for HTML, and will serve as your webroot.
